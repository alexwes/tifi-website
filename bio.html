          Growing up with an artist mother and a lawyer turned-to-finance father
          Estefania was always deeply immersed in the visual arts and finance
          worlds. Since 2001 Estefania has worked with art galleries, collectors,
          designers, dealers and artists in the US, Argentina and Europe, in both
          creative and administration roles, assisting sales, catalogue and book
          publications, exhibitions, and transportation. Works of the artists she
          acquired years ago have become part of the MoMA NY and other leading
          museum collections around the world. A work she owned was on loan and
          exhibited for several years at

          >
          Museum of Argentina, and other work of her collection was loaned for
          temporary exhibition. <br /><br />

          Estefania was a trend spotter in Buenos Aires for Mediaset, Italy's
          largest media conglomerate, from 1998 to 2003. Her responsibilities
          included identifying, reporting and contextualizing emerging trends in
          architecture, art, music and design as well as fashion. She reported to
          the management of the Corporate Research and Development Department in
          Milan.
          <br /><br />

          Estefania has been a collector of Latin American modern geometric art,
          and her collection includes works by Tomas Maldonado, Lidy Prati, and
          Alfredo Hlito among others. Estefania is an advisory member at the

            >Bienalsur</a
          >, International biennial of Contemporary Art. Artists such as Enio
          Iommi, Martin Blaszko and Juan Mele were frequent visitors to her home
          in Buenos Aires. <br /><br />

          While in her last year of college, Estefania became the founder and
          partner of Foco Diseno. A design company that for five years, until she
          left Argentina to study in New York, provided comprehensive design
          services to high profile corporate clients including leading hotels,
          beauty services companies, manufacturers, law firms and investment
          banks. Estefania graduated in 1994 from Universidad de Palermo in Buenos
          Aires with a undergraduate degree in Design, and later did design, art
          and advertising coursework at Parsons School of Design and NYU in New
          York. She is the mother of two children and lives and works in
          Manhattan, New York.
